# RSS Reader

In this Project, I tried to implement very Basic logics and mehods to make a RSS Reader App, I made this project programmatically in Objective C, and implemented some general features an app should have

Like :
Prevent Empty Link Entry
Prevent Duplicate Entry
Swipe to Delete RSS Links from UITableView
Prevent Wrong Link from Rendering
Fetched Navigation Title
Custom Image if No Thumbnail Found in RSS Feed
Swipe to Mark as Read an Article / (Mark as Unread)
Article will be marked as Read when user clicked on it etc
